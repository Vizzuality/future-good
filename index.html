						<h2>The philosophy of futuregood.</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<div class="txt-large">
							<p>We started Futuregood because the social changes needed in the future need people with a new skillset. To do this, we have to make sure our digital leaders are not held back by a lack of practical knowledge. More than a training course, Futuregood aims to inspire and enhance the bright, dedicated communities who want to change the future.</p>
						</div>
						<p>Vizzuality, the founding company of Futuregood, designs digital experiences that delight. Our approach to training is no different. Join us as we learn side-by-side in ways that are fun, supportive, and perfectly tailored to the needs of non-profit social good champions.</p>
						<p>Our first course, The MVP (something you’ll learn about on day one) is centered around the Project Manager.</p>

						<h2>Managing digital projects in non-profit organisations.</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="column">
						<div class="txt-large">
							<p>Confident, successful project managers use their interpersonal skills, creativity and eye for detail to manage the risks, difficult conversations and competing priorities associated with the development of digital products. In nearly a decade of working on hundreds of digital projects we’ve seen and felt the unique difficulties digital project managers face within the non-profit sector. Sometimes these challenges can be overwhelming. We want to change that.</p>
						</div>
						<p>Kicking-off with a personal, one-on-one session with a highly qualified and experienced coach, we’ll show you how to manage stakeholders and resources, communicate confidently, and take firm control of your digital projects. By the end of the course you’ll have a personalised action plan and set of tools that will help you deliver the kind of impact that leads to social change. And we hope you’ll have fun while doing it.</p>
